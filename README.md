# Lab 2 Roadmap
Khoi:

Current testing framework (regression tests mainly):
Step 1: Create test case in parser_test/basic_test folder (the naming convention is test_$type.txt)
Step 2: run the command "compiler467 -Tp $file_name"
Step 3: Create a new file with naming convention (test_$type_output.txt), copying the output from step 2 in it
Step 4: cd into the parser_test directory, and run python test.py

The remaining need to be tested:
1: type
2: unary and binary expression
3: operator precedence
4: function name

NOTE: do keep in mind tho, we still need to use our logic to see if the parser output makes sense,
this requires a bit of time
